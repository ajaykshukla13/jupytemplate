A simple template for jupyter notebooks.

The extension sets up any new Jupyter Notebook 
with a conventional and general-purpose
template to shape Data Science analysis.

The template includes conventional sections,
like *Data Import*, *Processing* and *References*,
as well as code to perform common operations, like
importing and configuring charting libraries. 

Moreover, it prompts for a meaningful name whenever
you try and save a notebook called 'Untitled'. 

Find this annoying? Don't worry, you can disable
this one.

## Motivation
Jupyter notebooks are awesome tools: they enable fast 
prototyping and ease result sharing. However, due to 
their flexibility, they are prone to be abused. 

In order to help Data Scientists keep their notebooks 
clean, a reasonably flexible yet conventional template
may help. Moreover, the template is also a 
productivity tool, speeding up common setup,
such as library import and configuration.

## Quick start
We assume Jupyter notebook is already installed in your environment.
However, even if this is not the case, don't worry: jupytemplate
declares Jupyter notebook as a dependency, thus any package manager,
like pip, will install it for you.

It is not mandatory, but you can install the full set of Jupyter 
extensions.
```shell
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
```
Feel free to visit [their repository](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)
for more information.

Now you can install the package:
```shell
pip install jupytemplate
```
Then, you have to install the javascript files from 
the Python package in a conventional jupyter directory:
```shell
jupyter nbextension install --py jupytemplate --sys-prefix
```
Finally, you may want to enable the extension:
```shell
jupyter nbextension enable jupytemplate/main --sys-prefix
```
You can easily enable, disable or configure the extension
by using the [nbextension_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)
server extension, as shown below.

## Editing the template
Template location can be found by running:   
```python
import jupytemplate
print(jupytemplate.get_template_path())
```
Of course, you can edit the template as you like, in order 
to adapt it to your own needs, but keep the file name `template.ipynb`.  
After editing the template, run:
```shell
jupyter nbextension install --py jupytemplate --sys-prefix
jupyter nbextension enable jupytemplate/main --sys-prefix
```
to make changes effective.
